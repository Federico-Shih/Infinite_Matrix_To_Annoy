This game is based on UE4 project: "How to Create a Simple Game in Unreal Engine 4" by Tommy Tran.

The tutorial consists of implementing the following features to the game:

- Move the player forward continuously
- Generate obstacles the player must avoid
- Randomize the obstacles to create variations
- Create a restart button that displays when the player hits an obstacle

For the assignment, new features must be implemented and these are:

1. Add a health system for the player.
2. Add a score.
3. Add health packs.
4. Add player projectile attacks.
5. Add enemies.
6. Increase the player speed over time.
7. Add one creative modification that is unique to your game.
